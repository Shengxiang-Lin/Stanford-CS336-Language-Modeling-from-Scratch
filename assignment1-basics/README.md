## Setup

### Environment
We manage our environments with `uv` to ensure reproducibility, portability, and ease of use.
Install `uv` [here](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) (recommended), or run `pip install uv`/`brew install uv`.
We recommend reading a bit about managing projects in `uv` [here](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/projects/#managing-dependencies) (you will not regret it!).

You can now run any code in the repo using
```sh
uv run <python_file_path>
```
and the environment will be automatically solved and activated when necessary.

### Run unit tests


```sh
uv run pytest
```

Initially, all tests should fail with `NotImplementedError`s.
To connect your implementation to the tests, complete the
functions in [./tests/adapters.py](./tests/adapters.py).

### Download data
Download the TinyStories data and a subsample of OpenWebText

``` sh
mkdir -p data
cd data

wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories/resolve/main/TinyStoriesV2-GPT4-train.txt
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories/resolve/main/TinyStoriesV2-GPT4-valid.txt

wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanford-cs336/owt-sample/resolve/main/owt_train.txt.gz
gunzip owt_train.txt.gz
wget https://huggingface.co/datasets/stanford-cs336/owt-sample/resolve/main/owt_valid.txt.gz
gunzip owt_valid.txt.gz

cd ..
```

### Experiment     
After your pass tests, you can use extra scripts in `scripts` to run some experiments, see the following instructions:  
1. Run `uv run python scripts/train_bpe.py`. Train the tokenizer.    
2. Run `uv run python scripts/tokenize.py`. Use the trained tokenizer to encode the original training data in `txt` format into integer ids and save it as a one-dimensional array in dat format for easy access during training.  
3. Run `uv run python scripts/train.py`. Train the model. The default configuration is to train for 5000 steps with a context length of 256 and a batch size of 32, which is a total of 256 x 32 x 5000 = 40M tokens.   
4. Run `uv run python scripts/generate.py`. Test the model's ability to generate stories.
